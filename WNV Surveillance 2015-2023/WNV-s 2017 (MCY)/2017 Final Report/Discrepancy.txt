Discrepancy in Week 33 historical average for vector abundance (between reported scores calculated with Reyes and new Graphpad file), why?

091918: Reyes and I traced it back to a single cell that was, for whatever reason, incorrect (week 33, 2008). The Week 33 2018 citywide abundance data in 
Graphpad read something like 17 when it should have, based on Excel data, read 33. Fixed this on the 2018 Prism file, left it as it was on the 2017
Prism files. 



Temperature loggers (minumum of two, 3-4 ideal, ethernet connections ideal but not necessary) 
and new humidifier (the same kind purchased before).
